### README for Medical Result Analysis and Suggestions Program

#### Overview
This C program, developed by **Sarthak Shukla**, is designed to analyze medical results and provide suggestions based on the user's input. The program focuses on three main areas:
1. **Blood Pressure Analysis**
2. **Lipid Profile Analysis**
3. **Diabetes Analysis**

The program takes user inputs for specific medical parameters and provides feedback on whether the values are within the normal range. If the values are outside the normal range, the program offers suggestions and lifestyle changes to help manage the condition.
